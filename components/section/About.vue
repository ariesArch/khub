                    The sun is a huge ball of gases. It has a diameter of 1,392,000 km. It is so huge that it can hold
                    millions of planets inside it. The Sun is mainly made up of hydrogen and helium gas. The surface of
                    the Sun is known as the photosphere. The photosphere is surrounded by a thin layer of gas known as
                    the chromospheres. Without the Sun, there would be no life on Earth. There would be no plants, no
                    animals and no human beings.
